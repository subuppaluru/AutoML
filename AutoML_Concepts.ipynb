        "**AutoGluon (2020):** This popular AutoML open-source toolkit developed by AWS helps in getting a strong predictive performance in various machine learning and deep learning models on text, image, and tabular data. Installation is supported for the Linux & Mac operating systems whereas Windows is not an officially supported OS for this toolkit.\n",
        "\n",
        "**MLBox (2017):**  Another well-known open-source Python-based AutoML library is MLBox. However, it is a powerful library that offers three sub-packages related to Pre-processing (to read and pre-process data), Optimization (to test and/or optimize the models) and Prediction (to predict the outcomes on a test dataset). Additionally, it can perform feature selection, hyper-parameter optimization, automatic model selection for classification and regression as well as predicting the target variables for selected models.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**AutoWEKA (2013):** Auto-WEKA uses a fully automated approach and leverages the Bayesian optimization to select a machine learning algorithm and set its hyperparameters. In other words, it helps in applying the best parameter settings for a given classification or regression task automatically to get a nice model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Auto-sklearn (2015):** This AutoML framework has been developed by Matthias Feurer, et al and according to the official documentation is based on Bayesian optimization, meta-learning, and ensemble construction. Algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning are automated using this framework. This framework only supports sklearn based models i.e. this is not suitable for graphical models or sequence prediction problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Auto-PyTorch (2019):** This framework has been developed by the AutoML Groups of the University of Freiburg and Hannover. It is based on the PyTorch deep learning framework and it supports the tabular data of classification and regression. Also, it can be applied to image data for classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Autokeras (2017):** It is an open-source library used in deep learning for automating tasks. It helps you in getting good neural network models for classification and regression tasks. The AutoML Toolkit has been built on top of the deep learning framework Keras, developed by the Datalab team at Texas A&M University. Since Auto-Keras follows the classic Scikit-Learn API design, the syntax is similar and easy to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "**TPOT (2018):** Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) is also one of the popular open-source AutoML frameworks which use sci-kit learn library as a part of its ML menu. According to the official documentation, it uses genetic programming to intelligently explore thousands of possible pipelines to find out a top-performing model pipeline for a given dataset. It is important to note here that TPOT does not perform any pre-processing of the dataset and hence, expects the fed dataset to be clean. However, it can perform feature processing, model selection, and hyperparameter optimization to return the best-performing model. It is a good choice for regression and classification problems but it is not suitable for NLP.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**H2O AutoML (2018):** The H2O 3 AutoML framework is an open-source toolkit best suited to both traditional neural networks and machine learning models. It can be used to automate the machine learning workflow i.e. model training and hyperparameter tuning of models within a specified time duration. It can perform data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, it returns with a leaderboard view of the model along with its performance. However, it is important to note that a java runtime environment is required since H2O AutoML has been developed in java.\n",
        "\n",
        "**MLJAR (2019):** This toolkit works with tabular datasets and offers transparency to the users in each step of the AutoML training. All information about the trained models is saved in the hard drive and is accessible to the ML user.\n",
        "\n",
        "**FEDOT** is an open-source framework used for automated modelling and machine learning [2], which helps in the construction of custom-built pipelines in an automated way. FEDOT open-source framework assists in classification (binary and multiclass), regression, clustering, and time series prediction tasks."
